# Sales & Profit Analysis Dashboard (2015–2024)

Hello!   
This project is a beginner-friendly Power BI dashboard that I created to analyze 10 years of sales and profit data from a Superstore dataset.

## What’s Inside?

I used a dataset named `Superstore_Sales_10Y.csv` which contains columns like:
 Order Date
 Region
 Category
 Sales
 Profit

I cleaned the data and created a new Month-Year column to show monthly sales trends in a clear way.

## What I Did:

 Imported and cleaned the CSV data
 Changed date format for better time visuals
 Created a new column for Month-Year (using DAX)
 Designed a dashboard using:
 Cards for KPIs (Total Sales & Profit)
 Bar chart for sales by region
 Pie chart for sales by category
 Line chart for monthly sales trend
 Styled the dashboard with soft background, borders, and titles

## Insights I Found:

 Total sales across 10 years is ₹10,003.6 with profit of ₹1,000.73
 Technology and Office Supplies are top categories
 South and West regions show high sales
 Most sales happened between 2015–2016

##  Tools Used:

 Power BI Desktop
 Basic DAX (for calculated column)
 Simple layout with cards, charts, and text

##  What I Can Improve Next:

 Add slicers for filters (year, region, category)
 Use tooltips for detailed hover info
 Format numbers with currency symbols
 Add buttons for page navigation (details page etc.)
